# Nested Podman — run Podman inside the `claudecontainer`

**Status:** approved approach — needs go-ahead to implement
**Created:** 2026-06-07
**Owner:** (unassigned)

## Goal

Make it possible to run `podman` *inside* the container that `make shell` launches,
so Claude Code (and the user) can build/run containers from within the sandbox —
e.g. building this very image, or CI-style nested builds.

## Hard constraint (user decision)

**Never run podman as root on the original host.** The host podman must stay
rootless. This is already the case (see "Confirmed host posture" below), and the
chosen approach preserves it.

---

## ✅ DECISION — Approach B: rootful-in-container, host stays rootless

Run the inner podman as the container's root (which is *only* host UID 1000 — a
mapped, unprivileged user, never host root). Add the required flags as an **opt-in**
Make variable so normal sessions stay minimal.

### What to change

1. **`Makefile`** — add `NESTED_PODMAN ?= 0`; when `=1`, append to the `shell`
   target's `podman run`:
   ```
   --device /dev/fuse \
   --security-opt label=disable \
   --cap-add=sys_admin,mknod \
   --tmpfs /var/lib/containers:rw,size=8g
   ```
   Keep it conditional, matching the existing `*_MOUNT` shell-detected vars.
   (Swap the `--tmpfs` for `-v podman-store:/var/lib/containers` later if we want the
   inner image cache to persist across sessions.)

2. **Image storage config** — bake a `storage.conf` into `entrypoint/dotfiles/` so the
   inner podman picks fuse-overlayfs automatically:
   ```ini
   # /root/.config/containers/storage.conf
   [storage]
   driver = "overlay"
   [storage.options.overlay]
   mount_program = "/usr/bin/fuse-overlayfs"
   ```

3. **Docs** — note the `NESTED_PODMAN=1` flag in `README.md` and the security
   trade-off in root `CLAUDE.md`.

### Why this approach

- Host stays **rootless** — satisfies the hard constraint. Breakout ceiling is host
  UID 1000, never host root, even with these flags or `--privileged`.
- `podman` is **already installed** in the image (`Dockerfile:267`) — no new packages.
- Minimal churn: fits the current "everything is root inside the container" image; no
  new users or subuid/subgid wiring needed.
- No daemon, no socket exposed.

### Costs we accept

- Storage: overlay-on-overlay under double user-namespaces → must use
  `fuse-overlayfs` (`/dev/fuse`); slower and more disk than native overlay.
- `--security-opt label=disable` drops SELinux isolation for that container.
- `--cap-add=sys_admin` is broad (still confined to the user namespace, but broad).
- Inner image store is ephemeral with `--tmpfs` — images re-pulled each session
  unless we switch to a named volume.

### Acceptance test (inside `make shell NESTED_PODMAN=1`)

```sh
podman info --format '{{.Store.GraphDriverName}}'   # -> fuse-overlayfs
podman pull docker.io/library/alpine
podman run --rm alpine echo "nested ok"
podman build -t selftest .                          # build THIS repo's image, nested
```

## Alternatives considered and declined

### ✗ Approach A — `--privileged`
```sh
podman run --privileged ... claudecontainer
```
**Declined:** broader than needed. Works, and under our rootless host it only grants
privilege *within* the user namespace (not host root), but Approach B's explicit,
narrow flags are preferable to a blanket `--privileged`.

### ✗ Approach C — rootless-in-container (no root even inside the container)
```sh
podman run --user podman --security-opt label=disable \
  --security-opt unmask=ALL --device /dev/fuse ... <image-with-podman-user>
```
**Declined for now:** most secure (nobody is root even inside the container), but
requires adding a dedicated non-root `podman` user to the image with `/etc/subuid` +
`/etc/subgid` ranges — significant churn against our root-centric image. Approach B
already satisfies the "never root on host" constraint, so C's extra isolation isn't
worth the rework yet. Revisit if we later want the sandbox itself to be unprivileged.

### ✗ Daemon-socket / `podman --remote`
```sh
podman run -v /run:/run ... podman --remote ...
```
**Declined:** leaks the host podman socket into the container ("can totally take over
the host machine"). Contradicts the security goal outright.

### vfs storage driver (fallback, not primary)
`-e STORAGE_DRIVER=vfs` avoids `/dev/fuse` entirely but is much slower and disk-heavy.
Keep only as a diagnostic if fuse-overlayfs misbehaves.

## Confirmed host posture (probed 2026-06-07)

The host podman launching this container is **rootless**:

- `/proc/self/uid_map` → `0 1000 1` : container-root (UID 0) maps to **host UID 1000**,
  a normal user. A rootful host would show an identity map (`0 0 …`).
- The bind-mounted `Makefile`, owned by host UID 1000, appears as `root` (0) inside —
  the classic rootless mapping.
- `container=oci`; subordinate range `524288` is the standard `/etc/subuid` allocation.

Implication: the security ceiling is host UID 1000, not host root — and it stays that
way through the nesting.

## Open questions

- Persist the inner image store (named volume) or keep ephemeral (`--tmpfs`)? Volume
  saves re-pulling but accumulates disk.
- Worth wiring "build this image from inside itself" as a permanent smoke test, or is
  the acceptance test above enough?
